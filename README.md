# Personal Data Handling Project

This project focuses on implementing secure practices for handling personal data, including Personally Identifiable Information (PII), logging, password encryption, and database authentication. Below are the objectives and requirements for this project.

## Objectives

1. **Examples of Personally Identifiable Information (PII):**
   - Understand and identify various types of PII such as full name, social security number, date of birth, etc.

2. **Implementing a Log Filter to Obfuscate PII Fields:**
   - Develop a log filter function to obfuscate PII fields within log messages, ensuring sensitive information is not exposed.

3. **Encrypting a Password and Checking Validity:**
   - Utilize the `bcrypt` package to securely hash passwords and implement functions for password encryption and validation.

4. **Authenticating to a Database Using Environment Variables:**
   - Securely authenticate to a database by utilizing environment variables to store sensitive information such as database credentials.

## Requirements

- Codebase must be written in Python 3.7 and adhere to Ubuntu 18.04 LTS compatibility.
- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines using pycodestyle (version 2.5).
- All files should be executable and end with a newline character.
- Include appropriate documentation for modules, classes, and functions.
- Annotate functions with type hints for clarity and maintainability.
- Ensure a README.md file is present at the root of the project folder.
- README.md should explain project objectives, requirements, and usage.
- Length of files will be tested using `wc`.
- Include detailed documentation explaining the purpose and usage of the project.
